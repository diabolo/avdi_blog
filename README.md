# Avdi Blog

This project is my workthrough of [Avdi Grimms](http://avdi.org) new [Object in
Rails](http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/11/15/early-access-beta-of-objects-on-rails-now-available-2/)
project. My version of this differs by:

1. Using RSpec
2. Using Cucumber features to drive. This means I have to 'guess' what
   features Avdi would have written

If you find this interesting it would be great if you support Avdi's project.
For $5 its a bargain
